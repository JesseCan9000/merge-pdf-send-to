# merge-pdf-send-to

In the Windows file explorer, ctrl + click on the PDFs you want to merge together, in the desired order. Then right click on them and do "Send to" -> merge_pdfs.exe

You first have to add the merge_pdfs.exe to the "Send to" menu:
- Search for Run on your PC, or hit Win + R
- In the Run menu, type shell:SendTo
- This should open a folder containing shortcuts to everything visible to the Send To menu
- Paste in a shortcut for merge_pdfs.exe
